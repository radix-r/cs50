1. What’s stdint.h?

- stdint.h is a header file that contains the standardization of the int data type

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program.

- doing so specifies size of the int in bits and weather it is signed or unsigned.  

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

- BYTE: 1, DWORD: 4, LONG: 4, WORD: 2

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats
(with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

- the first two bytes are corospond to the ASCII characters B and M

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

- bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file where as biSize is the bytes requilred by the struct BITMAPINFOHEADER 

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

- Negitive biHight indicates that the bitmap is top down meaning the origin is in the upper left corner
  as oposed to the lower left with a positive biHight

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

- biBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

- If there was an error opening the input file or the input does not exits. 

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

- Because in this case fread is only taking in one file

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

- 1

11. What does fseek do?

- fseek moves the position of the file's write pointer

12. What is SEEK_CUR?

- SEEK_CUR holds the current location of the write pointer in a file
